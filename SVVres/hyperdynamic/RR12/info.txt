SVV resolution test:

MCL generated dataset for Hyperdynamic condition.

Imposed respiration rate on the flow waveform is : 12 times/min

Each step correspond to a different level of SVV(%)

1st column: time (s)
2nd column: central flow (mL/sec)
3rd column: central pressure (mmHg)
4th column: peripheral pressure (mmHg)
